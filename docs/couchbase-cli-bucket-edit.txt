============================

NAME
----
couchbase-cli-bucket-edit - Edit a Couchbase data bucket


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli bucket-edit' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>] [--bucket <name>] [--bucket-ramsize <size>]
	  [--bucket-replica <num>] [--bucket-priority <priority>]
	  [--bucket-eviction-policy <policy>] [--enable-flush <num>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Modifies the settings of the bucket specified. Note that some settings can be
applied immediately while other settings may require a rebalance or the bucket
to be restarted resulting in potential application downtime. See information
about the settings that can be changed below to understand more about their
impact on your application.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--bucket <name>::
	The name of the bucket to edit.

--bucket-ramsize <size>::
	The amount of memory to allocate to the cache for this bucket in Megabytes.
	The memory quota of this bucket must fit into the overall cluster memory
	quota. The minimum cache size is 100MB.

--bucket-replica <num>::
	The amount of servers to replicate data to. Replicas provide protection
	against data loss by keeping copies of the data in this bucket on multiple
	servers. By default the number of replicas is one even if there is only a
	single server in the cluster. The minimum amount of replicas is zero and the
	maximum number is three. This option is only valid for couchbase buckets.

--bucket-priority <priority>::
	The disk I/O priority for this bucket. The value of this flag may be set to
	high or low. By default the priority is set to low. This option is only
	valid for couchbase buckets. This setting only has an affect on the disk IO
	if there are other buckets in the cluster.

--bucket-eviction-policy <policy>::
	The memory cache eviction policy for this bucket. Couchbase buckets support
	either "valueOnly" eviction or "fullEviction". Specifying the
	"valueEviction" policy means that each key stored in this bucket must be
	kept in memory. This is the default policy and using this policy will
	improve performance of key-value operations, but limits the maximum size of
	the bucket. Using the "fullEviction" policy means that performance will be
	impacted for key-value operations, but the maximum size of the bucket is
	unbounded.

--enable-flush <num>::
	Specifies whether or not the flush operation is allowed for this bucket. To
	enable flush set this option to "1". To disable flush set this option to
	"0". By default flush is disabled.

--enable-index-replica <num>::
	Enables replica view indexes for this bucket. There may be at most 1 view
	replica index. To enable replica indexes set the value of this option to
	"1". To disable replica indexes set the value of this option to "0". By
	default replica indexes are disabled.

EXAMPLES
--------

If we want to change the memory quota of the travel-data bucket we would run the
command below.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-edit -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket travel-data --bucket-ramsize 1024

If we want to change the amount of replicas from 1 to 2 on the cb-data bucket
then we would run the following commands below. Note that we need to rebalance
with the linkcbdoc:couchbase-cli-rebalance[1] in order to ensure that the
replicas are created.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-edit -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket travel-data --bucket-ramsize 1024 \
	 --bucket-replicas 2

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-edit -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password
