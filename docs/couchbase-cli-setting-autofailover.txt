NAME
----
couchbase-cli-setting-autofailover - Modifies auto-failover settings

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli setting-autofailover' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>] [--enable-auto-failover <num>]
	  [--auto-failover-timeout <seconds>]
	  [--enable-failover-on-data-disk-issues <num>]
	  [--failover-data-disk-period <seconds>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Auto-failover allows unresponsive servers to be failed over automatically by the
cluster manager. Data paritions in Couchbase are always served from a single
master node. As a result if a server is down in the cluster data from that
server will be not be available while that server is down. The server will
either need to be manually or automatically failed over in order to promote
replica data partitions on replica servers to active data partitions so that
they can be accessed by the application.

Since the administrator will not always be able to manually fail servers over
quickly enough to avoid application down time Couchbase provides an
auto-failover feature. This feature allows the cluster manager to automatically
fail over down nodes over and bring the cluster back to a healthy state as
quickly as possible.

In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition nodes can also be automatically failed
over when the Data Service reports sustained disk I/O failures.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--enable-auto-failover <num>::
	Specifies whether or not autofailover is enabled. Set this option to "1" to
	enable autofailover or "0" to disable autofailover.

--auto-failover-timeout <seconds>::
	Specifies the auto-failover timeout. This is the amount of time a node must
	be unresponsive before the cluster manager considers the node to be down and
	fails it over. The minimum auto-failover timeout is 30 seconds in Couchbase
	Community Edition and 5 seconds in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.

--enable-failover-on-data-disk-issues <num>::
	Specifies whether or not autofailover on Data Service disk issues is enabled.
	Set this option to "1" to enable failover on Data Service disk issue or
	"0" to disable it. "--failover-data-disk-period" needs to be set at the
	same time when enabling this option. This feature is only avliable in
	Couchbase Enterprise Edition.

--failover-data-disk-period <seconds>::
	Specifies the failover data disk period. This is the period of time over
	which the Data Service is checked for potential sustained Disk I/O
	failures. The Data Service is checked every second for disk failures. If
	60% of the checks during that time period report disk failures, then the
	node may be automatically failed over.
	"--enable-failover-on-data-disk-issues" must be set when this option is
	used. The failover data disk period ranges from 5 to 3600 seconds.

EXAMPLES
--------

To enable autofailover with a 30 second auto-failover timeout run the following
command.

	$ couchbase-cli setting-autofailover -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --enable-auto-failover 1 --auto-failover-timeout 30

To enable autofailover with a 120 second auto-failover timeout run the following
command.

	$ couchbase-cli setting-autofailover -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --enable-auto-failover 1 --auto-failover-timeout 120

To enable autofailover with a 120 second auto-failover timeout and to enable
failover on Data Service Disk issue with a 10 second data disk period run the
following command.

	$ couchbase-cli setting-autofailover -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --enable-auto-failover 1 --auto-failover-timeout 120 \
	 --enable-failover-on-data-disk-issues 1 --auto-failover-timeout 10

To disable autofailover run the following
command.

	$ couchbase-cli setting-autofailover -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --enable-auto-failover 0
