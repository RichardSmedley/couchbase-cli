couchbase-cli-reset-admin-password(1)
=====================================

NAME
----
couchbase-cli-reset-admin-password - Resets the Couchbase Server administrator password


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli reset-admin-password' [--cluster <url>] [--regenerate]
	  [--new-password <password>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command is used to reset the built-in Couchbase Server Administrator password.
There is only one built-in Administrator account, which is managed separately
from the internal and external Administrator users.
External and Internal Administrator
accounts can be managed using the linkcbdoc:couchbase-cli-user-manage[1] command.

The +reset-admin-password+ command must be run locally on a node that is part of the
cluster (i.e. must connect to the host the command is run on).
This is required as +reset-admin-password+
relies on a local authentication token, which is used to authenticate with the
server and change the password. As a result, the command does not require
credentials to be passed.

OPTIONS

--new-password <password>::
	Sets the password for the Couchbase Server administrator user to the value
        specified by the argument. If no password is
	specified, the command prompts the user for the new
	password through non-echoed stdin.

--regenerate::
	Sets the password for the Couchbase Server administrator user to a randomly
	generated value. The new password is printed to the command line after
	the password is changed.

To change the administrator password to a randomly generated value, run the
