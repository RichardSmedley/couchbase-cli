.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command allows administrators to assign and manage roles to different users in their organization\&. Users can either be managed locally by Couchbase or externally through the use of an external domain\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specfies the hostname of a node in the cluster\&. See the HOST FORMATS section for more information on specifying a hostname\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&. If this argument is specified, but no password is given then the command will prompt the user for a password through non\-echoed stdin\&. You may also specify your password by using the environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-delete
.RS 4
Deletes an RBAC user profile from the cluster\&. You must have full administrator privileges in order to delete a user profile\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-list
.RS 4
Lists all RBAC user profiles in the cluster and show their roles\&. You must have full administrator privileges in order to list all user profiles\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-my\-roles
.RS 4
Shows the current users RBAC user profile\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\-\-rbac\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the RBAC user to modify\&. This option is used when deleting, creating, or updating an RBAC user profile\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-rbac\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password to be used for an RBAC user profile\&. This option is used only when creating or updating a
\fIlocal\fR
RBAC user profile\&. Couchbase does not store password for
\fIexternal\fR
RBAC roles\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-rbac\-name <name>
.RS 4
Specifies the name to be used for an RBAC user profile\&. This option is used when creating or updating an RBAC user profile and it is recommanded that this option be set to the users full name\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-roles <roles_list>
.RS 4
Specifies the roles to be given to an RBAC user profile\&. This option is used when creating or updating an RBAC user profile and it is specified as a comma separated list of roles\&. See the ROLES section for more details on the available roles in Couchbase\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-auth\-domain <domain>
.RS 4
Specifies the auth_domain to used for an RBAC user profile\&. This option is used when deleting, creating or updating an RBAC user profile and it if may be set to either
\fIlocal\fR
or
\fIexternal\fR\&. Loacl users are users that are managed directly by the Couchbase cluster\&. External users are users managed by an external source suchas LDAP\&.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
couchbase://<addr>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
http://<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard installations\&. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091\&.
