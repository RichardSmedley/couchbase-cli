.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Modifies the settings of the bucket specified\&. Note that some settings can be applied immediately, while other settings either require a rebalance, or require the bucket to be restarted; resulting in potential application downtime\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster\&. See the HOST FORMATS section for more information on specifying a hostname\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&. If this argument is specified, but no password is given then the command will prompt the user for a password through non\-echoed stdin\&. You may also specify your password by using the environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bucket <name>
.RS 4
The name of the bucket to edit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bucket\-ramsize <size>
.RS 4
The amount of memory to allocate to the cache for this bucket, in Megabytes\&. The memory quota of this bucket must fit into the overall cluster memory quota\&. The minimum cache size is 100MB\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bucket\-replica <num>
.RS 4
The number of servers to which data is replicated\&. Replicas provide protection against data loss by keeping copies of a bucket\(cqs data on multiple servers\&. By default, the number of replicas is one, even if there is only a single server in the cluster\&. The minimum number of replicas is zero, and the maximum three\&. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bucket\-port <num>
.RS 4
Sets the port on which the bucket listens\&. This parameter is deprecated, and therefore not recommended for use\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bucket\-priority <priority>
.RS 4
Specifies the priority of this bucket\(cqs background tasks\&. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only\&. For Couchbase buckets, background task\-types include disk I/O, DCP stream\-processing, and item\-paging\&. For Ephemeral buckets, background task\-types are the same as for Couchbase buckets, with the exception of disk I/O, which does not apply to Ephemeral buckets\&. The value of this option may be "high" or "low"\&. The default is "low"\&. Specifying "high" may result in faster processing; but only when more than one bucket is defined for the cluster, and when different priority settings have been established among the buckets\&. When Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets have different priority settings, this affects the prioritization only of task\-types other than disk I/O\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bucket\-eviction\-policy <policy>
.RS 4
The memory\-cache eviction policy for this bucket\&. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Couchbase buckets support either "valueOnly" or "fullEviction"\&. Specifying
the "valueOnly" policy means that each key stored in this bucket must be
kept in memory\&. This is the default policy: using this policy improves
performance of key\-value operations, but limits the maximum size of the
bucket\&. Specifying the "fullEviction" policy means that performance is
impacted for key\-value operations, but the maximum size of the bucket is
unbounded\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Ephemeral buckets support either "noEviction" or "nruEviction"\&. Specifying
"noEviction" means that the bucket will not evict items from the cache if
the cache is full: this type of eviction policy should be used for in\-memory
database use\-cases\&. Specifying "nruEviction" means that items not recently
used will be evicted from memory, when all memory in the bucket is used:
this type of eviction policy should be used for caching use\-cases\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-\-enable\-flush <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not the flush operation is allowed for this bucket\&. To enable flushing, set this option to "1"\&. To disable flushing, set this option to "0"\&. By default, flushing is disabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-enable\-index\-replica <num>
.RS 4
Enables view index replication for the current bucket\&. This option is valid for Couchbase buckets only\&. To enable, set the value of this option to "1"\&. To disable, set the value of this option to "0"\&. By default, view index replication is disabled\&. There may be at most one replica view index\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-max\-ttl <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the maximum TTL (time\-to\-live) for all documents in bucket in seconds\&. If enabled and a document is mutated with no TTL or a TTL greater than than the maximum, its TTL will be set to the maximum TTL\&. Setting this option to 0 disables the use of max\-TTL and the largest TTL that is allowed is 2147483647\&. This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-compression\-mode <mode>
.RS 4
Specifies the compression\-mode of the bucket\&. There are three options; off, passive and active\&. All three modes are backwards compatible with older SDKs, where Couchbase Server will automatically uncompress documents for clients that do not understand the compression being used\&. This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Off: Couchbase Server will only compress document values when persisting to
disk\&. This is suitable for use cases where compression could have a
negative impact on performance\&. Please note it is expected that compression
in most use cases will improve performance\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Passive: Documents which were compressed by a client, or read compressed
from disk will be stored compress in\-memory\&. Couchbase Server will make
no additional attempt to compress documents that are not already compressed\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Active: Couchbase Server will actively and aggressively attempt to compress
documents, even if they have not been received in a compressed format\&. This
provides the benefits of compression even when the SDK clients are not
complicit\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-bucket\-port <num>
.RS 4
Removes the bucket\-port setting that might have been set in previous versions of Couchbase Server\&. The bucket\-port also knows as the dedicated port and server side moxi has been deprecated\&. In later versions of Couchbase Server a cluster will not be able to upgrade if a bucket has the dedicated port set\&. This option allows removal of that setting by setting it to 1\&.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
couchbase://<addr>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
http://<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard installations\&. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To change the memory quota of the travel\-data bucket, run the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli bucket\-edit \-c 192\&.168\&.1\&.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-password password \-\-bucket travel\-data \-\-bucket\-ramsize 1024
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To change the number of replicas for the travel\-data bucket to "2", run the following command\&. (Note that this requires a subsequent rebalance, by means of \fBcouchbase-cli-rebalance\fR(1), to ensure that the replicas are created\&.)
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli bucket\-edit \-c 192\&.168\&.1\&.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-password password \-\-bucket travel\-data \-\-bucket\-ramsize 1024 \e
 \-\-bucket\-replicas 2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To remove the bucket\-port from the test bucket
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli bucket\-edit \-c 192\&.168\&.1\&.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-password password \-\-bucket test \-\-remove\-bucket\-port 1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME Specifies the username to use when executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username argument on the command line\&.
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password argument on the command line\&. It also allows the user to ensure that their password are not cached in their command line history\&.
