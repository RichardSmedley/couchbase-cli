.SH "NAME"
couchbase-cli-master-password \- Sends the Couchbase master password
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIcouchbase\-cli master\-password\fR [\-\-new\-password <password>]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition has a "Secret Management" feature, which allows users to securely encrypt passwords and other sensitive configuration information that is stored on disk\&. These secrets must be stored in a secure way, and access must be controlled to reduce the risk of accidental exposure\&. By using Secret Management in Couchbase Server, secrets are written to disk in encrypted format\&. To decrypt these secrets, Couchbase requires the entering of a "master password", which is supplied by the user during server startup\&. This master password can be passed to the server using this command\&.
.sp
By default the Secret Management feature is disabled\&. To enable the feature, you must first set the master password\&. Once a master password is set, the user is required to enter it when the server starts up\&. This can be done by setting the environment variable CB_MASTER_PASSWORD=<password> during server startup\&. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable CB_WAIT_FOR_MASTER_PASSWORD=true, and then enter the master password using the couchbase\-cli master\-password command\&. This command must be run locally on the node that needs to be unlocked\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster\&. See the HOST FORMATS section for more information on specifying a hostname\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&. If this argument is specified, but no password is given then the command will prompt the user for a password through non\-echoed stdin\&. You may also specify your password by using the environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-send\-password
.RS 4
Sends the master password to the server that is waiting to start up\&.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
couchbase://<addr>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
http://<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard installations\&. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To use the Secret Management feature, the first thing you need to do is set a password on each node of the cluster\&. To do this, install and start Couchbase, but don\(cqt go through the setup process or initialize the cluster\&. Once Couchbase has started, run the following command to set the master password for your server\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-master\-password \-c 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 \-u Administrator \e
  \-p password \-\-new\-password password
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Once the master password has been set, you need to set the server environment variable CB_WAIT_FOR_MASTER_PASSWORD=true\&. You can do this by running the command below or by setting the variable in your \&.bashrc file\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ export CB_WAIT_FOR_MASTER_PASSWORD=true
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This environment variable will cause Couchbase to wait for the master password before starting up\&. Once it is set, you need to restart your cluster\&. Upon restarting the cluster you will notice that the server doesn\(cqt fully start\&. This is because it is waiting for you to enter the master password\&. You can do this by running the command below\&. The master\-passowrd subcommand has to be run locally on the node that is waiting for the master password\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli master\-password \-\-send\-password password
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME Specifies the username to use when executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username argument on the command line\&.
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password argument on the command line\&. It also allows the user to ensure that their password are not cached in their command line history\&.
