.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Initializes the first node in a Couchbase cluster\&. Before initializing a cluster you need to decide which services you will be running on this individual node as well as the memory quota for each service you are starting\&. Services started with cluster\-init will be local on this server only and future servers that are added to this cluster may be configured with different or similar services running on them\&. Note that the data service is always required on the first node\&. Memory quotas for each service are global settings and will apply to each node added to the cluster\&. The memory quota for a service only applies if that service is running on a given server\&. You may also define the index storage mode using the \-\-index\-storage\-setting which will determine how the global secondary indexes (GSI) are created\&. See the index storage mode parameter below for more details on how this parameter is set with cluster\-init\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specfies the hostname of the cluster to initialize\&. By default, this parameter is set to localhost:8091 for this command\&. See the HOST FORMATS section for more information on specifying a hostname\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cluster\-username
.RS 4
When starting a new cluster you need to create the Couchbase administrator user for the cluster\&. This user will be able to access the Couchbase Administration Console as well as be used for data access and future configuration\&. This option specifies the username for the administrator user\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cluster\-password
.RS 4
When starting a new cluster you need to create the Couchbase administrator user for the cluster\&. This user will be able to access the Couchbase Administration Console as well as be used for data access and future configuration\&. This option specifies the password for the administrator user\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cluster\-ramsize
.RS 4
Specifies the data services memory quota\&. This quota will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the data service\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cluster\-fts\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the full\-text service memory quota\&. This parameter is required if the full\-text service is specified in the \-\-services option\&. This quota will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the full\-text service\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cluster\-index\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the index service memory quota\&. This parameter is required if the index service is specified in the \-\-services option\&. This quota will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the index service\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cluster\-name
.RS 4
Sets the name for this cluster\&. Naming clusters is useful when you have multiple Couchbase clusters in your deployment\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cluster\-port
.RS 4
Specifies the port for the Couchbase Administration Console\&. Defaults to port 8091\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-index\-storage\-setting
.RS 4
Specifies the index storage mode for the index service\&. Accepted storage modes are "default" for the forestdb index backend or "memopt" for memory optimized indexes\&. If the index service is specified to be started with the \-\-services command then this parameter defaults to "default"\&. If the index service is not specified to be started then the index storage mode will not be set\&. You will then be required to set the index storage mode when the first index service is started on a server in the cluster\&. You may also define the index storage mode even if an index service is not started on the first node and it will be remembered when the first index service is added in the future\&. You may not change this parameter after it has been set\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-services
.RS 4
Specifies the services to start on this cluster\&. You may not change the services running on this node once the cluster has been initialized\&. This options takes a comma separated list of services\&. Accepted services are "data", "index", "query", and "fts"\&. If a user wants to start a cluster with the index and data service then they would specify \e\-\e\-service data,index\&. This parameter defaults to "data" to add only the data service\&.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
couchbase://<addr>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
http://<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard installations\&. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To create a Couchbase cluster with only the data service on the first node and a memory quota of 4096MB run the following command\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-init \-c 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 \-\-cluster\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-cluster\-password password \-\-services data \-\-cluster\-ramsize 4096
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If we want to create a Couchbase cluster with the data and index service then we also need to set the memory quotas for each service as well as the index storage mode since we are starting the index service\&.
.sp
To create a cluster with an index memory quota of 1024MB, a data service memory quota of 2048MB and a memory optimized index storage mode run the following command\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-init \-c 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 \-\-cluster\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-cluster\-password password \-\-services data,index \-\-cluster\-ramsize 2048 \e
 \-\-cluster\-index\-ramsize 1024 \-\-index\-storage\-setting memopt
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If we want to create a Couchbase cluster with all services then we need to set the memory quotas for the data, index, and full\-text service\&. We will set the quotas to 2048MB, 1024MB, and 1024MB respectively\&. We do not need to set a quota for the query service since it does not have a memory quota\&. We also need to set the index storage mode for the index service which we will set to "default" since we will be starting that service on our first node\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-init \-c 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 \-\-cluster\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-cluster\-password password \-\-services data,index,query,fts \e
 \-\-cluster\-ramsize 2048 \-\-cluster\-index\-ramsize 1024 \e
 \-\-cluster\-fts\-ramsize 1024 \-\-index\-storage\-setting default \e
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If we want to change the port number we can do so with the \-\-cluster\-port option\&. In the example below we will set up a cluster on port 5000 and start only the data service\&. We will set the memory quota of the data service to 2048MB\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-init \-c 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 \-\-cluster\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-cluster\-password password \-\-services data \-\-cluster\-ramsize 2048 \e
 \-\-cluster\-port 5000

.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
The cluster\-init subcommand sets up the first node on a Couchbase cluster\&. To set per node settings such as the data storage directory, index storage directory, or hostname see the linkcli:couchbase\-cli\-node\-init[1] command\&. To add nodes to a currently initialized cluster use the linkcli:couchbase\-cli\-server\-add[1] command\&. Some cluster settings may be changed after a cluster is initialized\&. Use the linkcli:couchbase\-cli\-setting\-cluster[1] command to edit these settings\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password argument on the command line\&. It also allows the user to ensure that their password are not cached in their command line history\&.
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password argument on the command line\&.
