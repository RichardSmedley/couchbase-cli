# Couchbase Command Line Tools

This package contains the command line tool set that performs
the same actions to provide the user the same capabilities as
the Couchbase Server web interface.

## Prerequisites

If you have installed the full Couchbase Server, these
tools will have all prerequisites required to run these tools.
If you run these tools standalone, you will need:

* Python 2.6 or greater
* Command shell such as bash

## Building the Documentation

The documents are located in [docs](docs). Man and HTLM versions are
generated using [generate.sh](docs/generated/generate.sh) script.
**asciidoc** and **xmlto** are used to generate the documentation so
both of those need to be installed.

### Mac requirements

```
brew install asciidoc xmlto
```

Need to set the path to the catalog files to generate the man pages:

```
XML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/local/etc/xml/catalog
```
